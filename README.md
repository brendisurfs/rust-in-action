# rust-in-action
## Code examples and snippets from the book.

This is a repo of me following along with the first book I have sat down and read for more than 2 hours straight since 6th grade. Good book.
I found this to be a better way to aid in my ever present need to learn Rust as much as I can. 

### end goal
Down the line, I would definitely like to have a job working with Rust.
But for now, the goal is to read and write Rust code fluently by the end of the year. 
Build tools, services, and solve other issues using Rust, and hopefully see some tangible benefit from that. 

### current tool I want to convert
I have a cron job that gets run for a project I am working on, and while the data isnt *massive* right now (only a few hundred entries in db),
it is getting close to 1000 after only one month of really being up, and that data entry is going to keep growing exponentially. 
I would like to see if I can start processing that data faster and not have to worry about the build breaking because Rust. Even cooler would be to do it with WASM.
